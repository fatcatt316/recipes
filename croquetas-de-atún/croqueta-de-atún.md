For the “Croquetas de atún”:Ingredients:
4 medium potatoes
2 cans of tuna in water or oil, well-drained
1 egg (for the mixture)
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup breadcrumbs (optional, for the mixture)
2 eggs (for coating)
1 cup breadcrumbs (for coating)
Vegetable oil for frying
Ketchup and mustard (for serving)Instructions:
Boil the potatoes
Peel the potatoes and boil them in a pot of water with a little salt until they are soft (approximately 20 minutes). Drain and let them cool slightly (the hotter they are the tougher it will be to make the croquettes).Prepare the mixture
Place the potatoes in a large bowl and mash them with a fork or potato masher until they become a rustic purée. Add the well-drained tuna, one egg, salt, pepper, and, if desired, a bit of breadcrumbs to improve consistency. Mix everything until you have a uniform dough.Shape the croquettes
Take portions of the mixture and shape them into patties (or elongated croquettes if you prefer). Place them on a tray or plate.Coat the croquettes
Beat the remaining 2 eggs in a shallow bowl. Dip each patty into the beaten egg and then into the breadcrumbs, ensuring they are well-coated.Fry the croquettes
Heat enough oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the croquettes on both sides until golden and crispy. Remove them and place them on paper towels to absorb excess oil.
